Zero-knowledge proof
In cryptography, a zero-knowledge proof or zero-knowledge protocol is a method by which one party (the prover) can prove to another party (the verifier) that a given statement is true, while avoiding conveying to the verifier any information beyond the mere fact of the statement's truth. The intuition underlying zero-knowledge proofs is that it ...

Given the size, novelty (zk) and pot (1.1m) of this contest (30+k, largest in C4 history?) think maybe the contest duration could be longer 😬?

For context: 
Maia: 12k+, 36 days
Tapioca: 13k+, 30 days

Not sure what went into consideration when deciding contest duration, but suggestion would be anywhere between 30-60 days, ofc only if sponsor is open @Vlad B | zkSync @portport @bender-ml @stasbreadless @zksync | ML @Sampka | ML

Maybe would have been better to split the contest into 3 different contest, each for the different programming languages. Make it 250k each and the best researchers for each language would have been on it. Now one must decide which part to focus on and I would guess 80% will focus on Solidity.  Then the code can be marked as audited but the hardest parts might not be audited properly. But that is just my humble opinion 😅

Given the short duration, some would argue that the best strategy from the auditor's point of view is to focus on a specific part of the codebase  (at least that's what I would do), which is _not_ necessarily the best outcome for the sponsor. C4 needs to also take that into consideration.

{Reactions}

[10/03/2023 14:32] vladbochok
This is a good one. Firstly, we expect bugs to be found between different components. To understand system contracts or bootloader you need to understand VM, to understand L1 contracts you need to know what checks are done on L2 and what enforces it. That's why I (personally) think having three different pools will make a separation between components and will provide the same value as having three different contests where a complete picture of the system will be missed.

Normal if no H/M is found in a contest, the contest pool for H/Ms is shared amongst the wardens with a Grade a QA report, 
If no H/M is found the amount shared would be $330k but a situation where medium/s is found the contest pool would be increased to 700k approx to be shared amongst wardens who found such severity. 
I believe the point for doing this is to avoid sharing $1.1m to wardens if the are incapable of finding a medium or high severity issue in the codebase.

I do expect most people will pick their favorite area (L1 or L2 smart contracts, VM, or circuits) and focus there. Edit: there could be unique findings if you compare between two components)

Specifically for the 20k lines of circuit code: I think you will find the code is not actually that dense, and you can work through many lines very quickly

Where is mailbox deployed?


[10/04/2023 11:41] vladbochok
Mailbox is deployed as a contract, that is facet of Diamond Proxy


[10/04/2023 11:41] supernovahs

[10/04/2023 12:26] vladbochok
L1 weth bridge calls zkSync diamond proxy contract `requestL2Transaction` function. This function place transaction request into the priority queue. Transaction requests from priority queue will be processed by operator in one of the batches.

Is `bootloader.yul`  also included in this special kernel space?


[10/04/2023 14:13] supernovahs
So L1 weth bridge calls finalizedeposit on l2wethbridge , this transaction goes to queue , and operator takes this , and simply calls the l2 weth bridge . 
Any other actors in between here that I'm missing? 
Like mailbox ?


[10/04/2023 14:13] csjaybit
if I want to focus on EVM then do i need to read  all docs or EVM only??


[10/04/2023 14:15] vladbochok
Yes, but bootloader address is formal (when bootloader program starts the execution the address of this is 0x8001, but nothing is deployed on that address)


[10/04/2023 14:18] vladbochok
Mailbox is a part of the diamond proxy, so it is kind of one big contract where the queue is stored. Executor is also a part of the diamond proxy and manages the state transition. When state transition happens (commitBatches/proveBatches/executeBatches) L1 -> L2 transactions are taken from the queue.


[10/04/2023 14:18] vladbochok
Do you want to concentrate on circuits or pure VM implementation?


[10/04/2023 14:19] csjaybit
let me check sir


[10/04/2023 14:22] ch_301
So the bootloader is an implementation in the client and the operator will use it?


[10/04/2023 14:23] csjaybit
circuits cause VM is written in rust


[10/04/2023 14:23] vladbochok
It is the only program that EraVM runs in the state transition, all transactions and other blockchain context is written there


[10/04/2023 14:24] vladbochok
Circuits are also written in Rust


[10/04/2023 14:25] csjaybit
for system contracts then??


[10/04/2023 14:25] supernovahs

Okay.


[10/05/2023 13:04] vladbochok
So, you can think about zkSync as a separate blockchain with trustless bridge to Ethereum (in fact it is more than that, but for simplicity). zkSync have one centralized node at the moment where all transactions are executed. System contracts and bootloader are deployed on this specific blockchain and if user wants to make a transaction, yes, they should call zkSync RPC but it is separate instance RPC from Ethereum.

I'm having trouble finding info about the validator role.
This recent article (https://medium.com/code4rena/zksync-and-code4rena-securing-ethereums-future-with-1-1m-in-the-arena-29811bb2479f) says "validators must have a consensus that a block is valid. Once agreed upon, they generate the zero-knowledge proofs." First, is that accurate?
That's L2 activity, but I can't find any mention of "validator" in L2 code / docs.

On the other hand, `validators` mapping whitelists addresses on L1 that can process batches. I likewise haven't found documentation about their role. (E.g. Are they trusted? What triggers them to call the Executor functions?)

[10/05/2023 17:12] vladbochok
So, the validator is an entity that sequences transactions in the order (make a batch with transactions), processes them, and creates zk proof for their execution. The validator is not trusted in a term that the validator shouldn’t be able to steal the funds of the user. However, in the current form, it can provide or not refund for user transactions (this is trusted).

What's the purpose of the `VerifierParams` struct and each of its fields?


[10/05/2023 22:37] vladbochok
So to verify zk circuits we need to generate verification keys. Verification keys are parameters for verifier so that verifier would accept proof only for specific zk circuit. 
`VerifierParams` are also parameters for verifier smart contract, but specific to our circuit architecture. In our architecture we do have recursive proofs. That means one zk proof can verify another one. The main circuit that do recursion and verify other proofs take as input hash of verification keys for other circuits - VerificationParams.

Is there a zkSync equivalent to what Ganache or Anvil provides for Ethereum?


I'm brainstorming ways to run the System Contracts on a local network.
I understand that there may not be an exact equivalent, as the zkSync chain is the very subject of our auditing efforts, making it non-live. However, it doesn't hurt to inquire about the possibility of having a local network version.


I'm not even sure if my question makes that much sense.

If you have such bot you can practice in these


[10/06/2023 06:56] portport
We sometimes want to run multiple copies of the same circuit back-to-back. It's important that the end state of one circuit (FSM_output for circuit 1) is the same as the start state of the next circuit (FSM_input for circuit 2). So yes the struct is the same for both, but it's nice to have the distinction between start and end states

What do you mean? To the L1 or inside L2?


[10/06/2023 16:18] vladbochok
Bootloader and EmptyContract are completely different contracts


[10/06/2023 17:06] ustas.eth
> The hash of the code of the bootloader is stored on L1 and can only be changed as a part of a system upgrade. Note, that unlike system contracts, the bootloader’s code is not stored anywhere on L2. That’s why we may sometimes refer to the bootloader’s address as formal. It only exists for the sake of providing some value to this / msg.sender/etc. When someone calls the bootloader address (e.g. to pay fees) the EmptyContract’s code is actually invoked.

hi I am a bit confused

If ANY valid Medium severity issue is found, audit pot increases to $770,000.
If ANY valid High severity issue is found, audit pot increases to $1,100,000.

this increase in the pot if any medium/high severity is found will only increase HM awards am I correct (as opposed to QA + low + gas + HM)?

what does this dollar mean in $(L2_TX_MAX_GAS_LIMIT); //Config.sol


[10/09/2023 17:41] aamirusmani1552
explanation from copilot:
```
GitHub Copilot: The syntax you are referring to is called a code placeholder. It is used by the AI to insert dynamic content into code snippets. The placeholder is represented by a dollar sign followed by parentheses, like this: `$(placeholder)`. 

When you see a placeholder in the code, it means that the AI has replaced it with a value that it thinks is appropriate for the context. In the case of the code you provided, the placeholders are likely replaced with actual values by the AI before the code is executed.
```

This is syntax from solpp preprocessor, the tool we run before contract compilation. It takes the source code and then modify it by placing env variable or other expressions instead of placeholders.

Yeah, so it is definitely worth looking into the circuit logic, missing constraints, and how circuits are connected together. The proof system math is excluded from the scope though.

What does the `gas()` instruction return in the Bootloader context? It must be the gas limit set by the operator for the entire batch execution, correct? Then I wonder about the purpose of the `checkEnoughGas()` function. If `gas()` ever runs out during some of the calls in a batch transaction, won't it simply revert automatically?
https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-zksync/blob/ebec640786cf3cb791fa77a856ad9d2a554dad3f/code/system-contracts/bootloader/bootloader.yul#L1195

[10/10/2023 11:15] vladbochok
`gas()` in the context of Bootloader returns the same thing as in the context of other contracts. Bootloader is just a programs that runs on EraVM, so it has the same properties + some additional permissions and features due to the fact that this is the first program. First programs starts with 2^32 - 1 gas available for the execution.

It is not node, L2 inherits security from L1, that means everything should go through L1 contract.

So L1 contract - ExecutorFacet manage this, `executeBatch` function finalize the L2 state. It checks logs that bootloader sent, each log should from bootloader should contains hash of L1 -> L2 transactions that were executed in the batch.

Yes, it is out of scope


[10/11/2023 10:19] vladbochok
Legacy and/or premature optimization. In previous version of zkSync (now it is called zkSync Lite) we used single implementation proxy (as UUPS or TransparentUpgradeableProxy) and had a problem with bytecode size. Basically implementation contract was too big to be deployed onchain. So, we change long revert messages to something shorter to save bytecode space.

I know this may sound complicated, but you can use this to help find whether the bot has a finding: https://illilli000.github.io/races/2023-07-lens/scorer2.html paste the rubric from the bottom of the raw bot report, then click `[add]` and provide your finding in this format: `### N-<n> <title>`, e.g. `### N-01 Possible rounding issue`, then click the score button, and it'll show you whether it knows about such a finding (the rubric column), based on a fuzzy match of the title you provided, checked against previous bot reports

[10/13/2023 09:32] vladbochok
That's correct


[10/13/2023 09:34] vladbochok
It is the first program that EraVM executed (and the only one program). You can think about it as for Operation System for the computer, it manages what transaction can be executed, what to check and how and much to take the fee. 

But it is not deployed contract, it is the convention that bootloader is executed by EraVM as the only program. On the L1, we do check that proof corresponds to the bootloader execution with the exact bootlaoder hash.


[10/13/2023 09:35] vladbochok
No, while bootloader started the execution on EraVM and even has some formal address (0x8001) any call to bootloader in the call frame will execute `EmptyContract.sol`


[10/13/2023 09:53] sp1cymeatball
mimicCall can only be executed by system contracts?

it is used for custom opcodes https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/yul.html#verbatim

Why you use _claimining variable in _verifyDepositLimit() of L1ERC20Bridge.sol . Can u please tell me the perspective of using this


[10/14/2023 07:05] adeolu
`_verifyDepositLimit()` is used in two ways.  when adding to total user deposit  (in `deposit()`) and when subtracting from it (via `claimFailedDeposit()`). `_claiming` is true for `claimFailedDeposit()` and false for the other.

[10/14/2023 23:06] dontonka
those are replaced at compile time with some value coming from configuration somewhere. if you search for the value inside the $(), id bet you will get some hits in some config files. that was asked already a few times.

which hashes are you referring, your question is vague, can you be more specific on your question?


[10/14/2023 23:25] mylifechangefast.eth
What I mean is that how does the protocol ensure that  no contract with unknown bytescode is ever deployed?


[10/15/2023 02:12] dontonka
not in front of my computer rigth now, but there is a system contract that is used for this exact purpose I believe, dont quote me had some 🍺 already 😅. check in contract deployer, it does call such contract before deploying.

Hi guys. I can't totally understand one moment. How eth from L1 converts to eth on L2. When we send it from L1 the msg.value stays in the Mailbox contract. Function finalize deposit on the L2bridge can be called by an aliase of L1bridge i.e. by a contract that represents L1bridge on L2 and this L1bridge should have some msg.value = amount deposited on L1 . Where does it come from?


[10/15/2023 12:33] dontonka
bootloader will do this when the executing this L1->L2 tx, using L2ethToken and MsgValueSimulator.

Thanks, I thought that this simulator contract is some test thing😀

is there any part of the docs that compares major changes between contracts in scope and the ones currnetly deployed ?


[10/17/2023 01:39] tamayonft
how can i know what contracts are already onchain?

I got a question on the EraVM docs. for the first two add lines it states that it writes to r0, but wasnt r0 always 0? and the r2 should be the register to write the stack value to, right?

no the `operator` is the one that runs the zkSync node itself (which run the bootloader etc), so to answer your question, it's neither XD.

could anyone explain to me how exactly modifier `onlyCallFromBootloader` should work? How/when those functions can be called?


[10/20/2023 00:20] minh___
only bootloader can/will call it, as the name suggests

you can see the calls directly in `bootloader.yul` (you just cant strg+f for them, since it works a bit different)


[10/20/2023 00:34] lsaudit
thanks!


[10/20/2023 01:10] dontonka
when running the `one-liner` for `system-contracts`, while bootloader is compiled if needed, seems like no tests from system contract are actually testing the bootloader code 🤔 ? As if I comment the  `processTx` from the main loop, and all the test pass.

Bootloader tests are integrated to the server, and require some understanding on how server works with the bootloader (not theoretically, but for the exact implementation) so it was decided to exclude them from the contest.

this doc says a couple of second


[10/20/2023 16:41] viktor_cortess
Hi guys, I see in the docs: "A new priority operation can be appended by calling the requestL2Transaction method on L1" , but there is a modifier. Deposit functions in Bridges have modifiers too. So in reality any user will be able to call requestL2Transaction without bridges? Or it will be dApps that will be using services of ZK-sync?


[10/20/2023 16:58] vladbochok

Thanks. And in this call "zkSync.requestL2Transaction{value: msg.value}" , the msg.value is all the fees that we pay to ZKsync, and in case some gas left it will be sent to the refund recipient?

So, a contract can pass non-zero register to the call in case `systemCall` flag is set to true. We use this non-standard ABI for efficiency and to distinguish EVM ABI that users can use. `MsgValueSimulator` is using register for getting (value, to, isSystemCall) parameters to the call that is need to be mimic. In case `to` == `msgValueSimulator` address and `isSystemCall` is set to true then `MsgValueSimulator` reenter itself with registers that caller didn't set in purpose (some not cleaned register that `MsgValueSimulator` used in the execution).  

> due to WILL mess up the registers and WILL use r1-r4 for our standard ABI convention and r5 for the extra who_to_mimic argument or due to the usage of registers in performing operations? 
They are coming due to usage of `isSystemCall` and they are messy due to not specific setting of such register, but rather using register that is left from the execution.

> And what is meant by the return value being WILL mess up the registers and WILL use r1-r4 for our standard ABI convention and r5 for the extra who_to_mimic argument for the mimic_call_byref opcode?
That's being said, register in the frame will be passed to the next frame if `isSystemCall` flag is set.

Hey, Im trying following the docs on the in-memory node for testing (era_test_node). Now just running "era_test_node run" works fine as it spins up the server locally. However doing "era_test_node fork testnet" fails, with an error message that the version (16?) is not support by the binary ( see picture). Any idea how to fix? ( downloaded the lastest version from one of the git links above)

Hello to everyone who is fighting in the last two days. 
Do I understand it correctly? The refund recipient for eth/weth is alwas on L2? So why do we have this comment in the bootloader? What issue on L1 if the refund always goes to L2

// In case of an issue in L1 contracts, we still will be able to process tx.
                    refundRecipient := and(refundRecipient, sub(shl(160, 1), 1))

its just a safety net in case the L1 puts something larger than uint160 into reserved[1] (it doesnt, as can be seen in Mailbox)

I believe that code4rena should consider some kind of pyramidal submission evaluation.    Similar to what happens in customer support.   Otherwise this will become imposible to hand soon.


[10/27/2023 19:42] peritoflores
Another concern is regarding issue submission... It would be a good idea to write hash of the report on chain and then warden could release the report after submission date.

Pretty sure this is in violation of backstage as well as unprofessional


[11/02/2023 18:27] ustas.eth
Sorry if it was, unintended 🙏 Could you point out what rule did I missed? I thought backstage privacy is about content of the findings, not their total count?


[11/02/2023 18:44] un_for_given
backstage is very unfair feature of the Code4rena! warden without backstage access are in dark until the final result! and also:
1. they can't escalate their issues (losing valid issues because of reports lack some facts)
2. other wardens can escalate and downgrade their issues!!
3. they can only see the contest result (including their issues) only after final report which is 2-4 month later most of the time.
4. wardens with backstage access can add POC, extra proof and evidence to their submission in scalation phase, it means they have 1 month more than other wardens(without access) to participate in contest.

there was a feature request that each warden sees his/her own issues and escalate them before final result, but even after more than one year, this feature is not implemented.

the most sad part is because of no escalation, this happens:
- warden **solo** HIGH and MEDIUM most likely is going to be set as invalid, because of the issue's nature, it is solo!! no one knows about it and it's hard to imagine that bug.

I suggest to give all wardens ability to escalate their reports ASAP.

How to get backstage role?


[11/02/2023 19:02] 0k_sec
as i faced this issue a lot i can agree with that and KYC is really annoying in some country and cases but i'm pretty sure that the reason the c4 team include the backstage rule for certified holder is to make this environment more secure for protocols (some codebases are really on mainnet and its not save to allow everyone to check the valid issues) but still agree with the dark side we face if we don't have backstage rule


[11/02/2023 19:04] un_for_given
when you have 1000 warden with backstage access, so the safety of submission and security of protocol is just an illusion.
anyone with malicious intention can get backstage access easily, so this backstage doesn't protect against it at all.


[11/02/2023 19:04] un_for_given
there is no logical reason for backstage. (except one)


[11/02/2023 19:05] 0k_sec
but they should provide IDs and more information before becoming a backstage holder and this will prevent any bad acting i think


[11/02/2023 19:07] un_for_given
it doesn't prevent bad actor, because bad actor knows he/she is one of the 1000 warden with backstage access.
any bad action happens, how will you know which one of the 1000 wardens with bad intention did the bad action?


[11/02/2023 19:08] 0k_sec
hmmm its somehow true, maybe c4 team have a way to fix this issue too (jay from c4 typing so maybe you get the answer soon )

technically this is related to zkSync audit too. 
zkSync audit has "post-contest triage and post-judging QA" which involves backstage access.

This is from code4rena docs about "Fundamental principles":

> **Fundamental principles**
> These are the fundamental principles that underly how we look at the question of “fairness” in Code4rena.
> 1.** Code4rena aims to be a fair and impartial system.**
> 2. Where the system is insufficient or vague, we depend on the judgment of fair and impartial individuals.

the most sad part is because of no escalation, this happens:
- warden **solo** HIGH and MEDIUM most likely is going to be set as invalid, because of the issue's nature, it is solo!! no one knows about it and it's hard to imagine that bug.

You should be happy then ;), if you can squeeze those in Immunefi (which is usally harder depending on the program and assets in scope if following primacy of rules only), that will probably give you even a better payout, farther down the line, payout are always usually higher as code has been battle-audited at that level.

[11/27/2023 14:57] _paperparachute
Post-judging hasn't even started for this audit. If you've been asked for a PoC you have however long initial judging takes and then the 48 hour Post-judging QA period to submit it.


[11/27/2023 14:58] un_for_given
how do we know if we are required a POC for our submission?


[11/27/2023 15:00] _paperparachute
If the judge asks for one either via Discord or Github. The general concensus is "If you _can_ provide a PoC, then do" as it increases the quality of your finding, and sometimes even the severity if your PoC provides a better understanding of an exploit


[11/27/2023 19:16] lsaudit

Your comment should provide any and all additional context the judge requires to make a final decision. It's not feasible for the judge to engage in prolonged discussions of every issue raised in QA.

Hey, stupid question about Post-judging QA. During the Post-judging QA I've escalated some of my QAs (that they should have been graded as R/L instead of NC). I haven't noticed, that my QA has been already graded-A, so reviewing those issue won't change a thing. Should I/can I add additional comment in the discussion that there's no need to review my QA, since it's already graded-A or should I leave it as it is and don't comment  anything rn? I don't wanna give the judge extra work if there's no need for that

This was a very high bounty pot contest and it requires more than due diligence to have the final verdict that reflects directly on rewards which we can easily pronounce tens of thousands of dollars per warden easily.
The Judge, the Sponsors and the Lookouts already showed a tremendous dedication in this contest.
Waiting for a couple of days more would bring a happy new year start imo.

Don't forget that he is still one of the best in this field, and let's not judge him based on one mistake.

how can we be sure that this is the opinion of a real person, and not just another HE1M accomplice. (joke)

Everything is possible, but let's not judge hastily, just as we don't always trust developers codes.

Yes, thank you. 

People make mistakes. We have all had lapses in judgment for self-centered reasons. 

We aren’t a community that shames people. We believe people can grow and learn.

[01/16/2024 19:31] adriro
will this count for 2023 or 2024? 🤔


[01/16/2024 19:32] 0xsorrynotsorry
Not sure about the implementation tbh


[01/16/2024 19:43] sockdrawermoney
expect it to change; I believe there's some re-modeling of the data that's coming which will eventually make leaderboard data align with date of audit (and possibly even date of individual submission) rather than date of leaderboard update

Wardens, we are getting close.  Award calculations are done and we are coordinating with the sponsor on marketing plans.

I was going to say the same thing, but then I remembered that spots are awarded based on the 90-day leaderboard (with a few exceptions). I've never participated in a private contest. Maybe that'll change in a few months 😅

@🦙 liveactionllama | C4 I wonder why i wasn't tagged as usual in your post 🤔 ? i mean i still see my name that's good, just wonder why this time around I was not tagged.


[01/18/2024 01:37] dontonka
congrats man, that was big one sir! niche in `non-solidity` language is the best you can do, solidity is very crowded already.

[01/18/2024 01:40] liveactionllamac4
Hi! Typically our tooling won't tag a warden if they haven't yet verified their discord within their C4 account settings (see announcement [here](https://discord.com/channels/810916927919620096/810929015509483554/1154361607044988948)). If you have already verified your discord though, please submit a [help request](https://code4rena.com/help) and our team can look into it! 🙂


[01/18/2024 01:40] dontonka
ah this has changed cause i was tagged in the past. no i don't think i did such verification indeed.


[01/18/2024 01:45] liveactionllamac4
Yeah, semi-recent. If you are logged into the C4 website, expand the menu at the bottom of the left nav bar. Then go to Settings > Account Settings, you should see an option to verify your Discord there. After that, you should be tagged in future cases when you win awards. 🙂

Hi. I can't find `findings.csv` file in https://github.com/code-423n4/code423n4.com/tree/main/_data. Is there any other way to understand results of each bug independently?

Any uncertainty about what happened with issues will have to wait for the report and repo to be made public.


[01/18/2024 11:14] alextheentreprenerd
Congrats to the winners!
If you spent a lot of time waiting for an underwhelming result, my recommendation is to focus on your own actions, there's a lot of contests you could have participated in, instead of waiting for the results

My two report got accepted (confirmed by judge and sponsor) and got zero reward, I believe this is not a case to wait for the report to go public as its confirmed. But got zero reward 😦


[01/18/2024 12:02] al_qa_qa
IDK if this is legal or not according to code4rena rules.

But you can take the title of the issues you submitted, and let any backstager search them, and inform you by there status.


[01/18/2024 12:04] 0k_sec
Zk contest was open to all to check their issues that why i’am sure about it and even the c4 team set it to grade c, idk if grade c get zero reward as this is first time know that 🤔


[01/18/2024 12:05] _paperparachute
grade-c labels mean you won't receive a reward.

Just want to clarify that this would be against the C4 backstage rules.

Although, as 0xkazim pointed out, they already have access in this case for zksync, since all participants were given access as part of a post-judging QA experiment. 🙂

is it s bug of math heavy or business logic?


[02/13/2024 05:19] dontonka
That will happen only once the report is made public, unfortunately. your other option is to get back-stage access, tbh on C4 that's really a must as soon as you can.

Whatever anyone says to you, access to backstage and being able to fight in Post-QA is a `big deal`. In my last contest, I had an issue which was qualified as QA by the lookout, with about 6 duplicates, judge agreed with the lookout, then I demonstrated in PostQA why this was a High, sponsor confirmed, then judge increased to Medium only somehow. Post QA concluded. I ping again the judge in the PostQA discussion trying to understand why this was not classified as a High, then after few days the judge agreed to increase as High. So my issue started as a QA with 6 full duplicates and with my input in PostQA concluded as a High with only 3 duplicates (mine primary, the 2 other partial-25). I don't think this is an exceptional case and happen from time to time.
